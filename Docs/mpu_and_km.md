# Memory Protection & Key Management Implementation Plan

This document outlines the key features and implementation roadmap for memory protection configuration and key management functionality, targeting STM32 series MCUs.

## Core Features to Implement

### 1. Read-Out Protection (RDP)
- Implement RDP level switching:
  - Level 0 → Level 1: Prevents external access via debug tools.
  - Level 1 → Level 0: Triggers full memory erase on downgrade.
- Verify debug interface is disabled in Level 1.
- Confirm memory wipe behavior when reverting to Level 0.

### 2. Write Protection (WRP)
- Configure WRP on selected Flash sectors.
- Block write/erase operations on protected sectors.
- Monitor error flags (`WRPERR`) for protection violations.

### 3. Proprietary Code Read-Out Protection (PCROP)
- Enable PCROP for key handling code sections.
- Allow I-code execution while blocking D-bus read/write access.
- Check error flags: `RDERR` for reads, `WRPERR` for writes.

### 4. One-Time Programmable Memory (OTP)
- Program secure data to OTP blocks.
- Configure `LOCKBi` bits to permanently lock data.
- Prevent overwriting once locked; verify persistence across resets.

### 5. Key Management (KM)
- Determine secure key storage location (OTP or protected Flash).
- Implement:
  - Key write and read functions
  - Access control for key usage
  - Cryptographic operations using stored keys (e.g., AES, ECC)
  - Secure key erase/rollback handling
- Validate key lifecycle management in secure environment.

### 6. Error Handling & Recovery
- Detect access violations via protection flags.
- Provide fallback logic for decryption/key validation failures.
- Integrate secure initialization routines (optional: Secure Boot).

## Test Cases to Cover

- Transition RDP levels and verify expected behavior
- Attempt illegal access to WRP/PCROP regions
- Program, lock, and reaccess OTP blocks
- Simulate error conditions and analyze fault recovery
- Execute full protection chain:
  1. Activate RDP Level 1
  2. Enable PCROP for sensitive code
  3. Lock flash sectors with WRP
  4. Store keys in OTP with `LOCKBi`
  5. Run key operations securely
